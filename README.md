In the final assignment for JavaScript 1, I've tried to shape the different parts of this task based on what I've managed to learn so far. Inside this folder, outside this readME file, we can find:
## index.html
**Files that belong to this html-file:**
``` 
CSS > style.css and media.css
JS > script.js and JS > components > errorMessage.js
```
## paged/details.html
**Files that belong to this html-file:**
``` 
CSS > style.css and media.css
JS > details.js and JS > components > errorMessage.js
```
## pages/contact.html
**Files that belong to this html-file:**
``` 
CSS > contact.css
JS > contactForm.js 
```
