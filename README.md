In the final assignment for JavaScript 1, I've tried to shape the different parts of this task based on what I've managed to learn so far. Media Queries are located at the very end of each associated CSS file instead of in a completely separate css file collected, and codes that are repeated like nav-, footer- and other layout variables are placed inside the subfolder ``featured``.  
## index.html
**Files that belong to this html-file:**
``` 
css > style.css
js > script.js and js> constants>errorMessage.js
```
## paged/details.html
**Files that belong to this html-file:**
``` 
css > pages/details.css
js > details.js and js> constants>errorMessage.js
```
## pages/form.html (contact form)
**Files that belong to this html-file:**
``` 
css > pages/form.css
js > components/form.js
```
